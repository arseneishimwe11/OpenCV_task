# Coordinate Detection and Region Annotation Using OpenCV

## Overview

In this task, I first used OpenCV to detect specific coordinates on the screen by clicking on a point in the given image using the `display_coordinates` script.  
- The primary goal was to automate or simplify the process of gathering coordinates.
- The process involves capturing the screen, handling mouse events, and processing the selected coordinates.

After obtaining the exact coordinates, I used OpenCV again to:
- Draw a rectangle around the specified region.
- Add the plate number text, as indicated.
